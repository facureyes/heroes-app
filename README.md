# Heroes App

This project was created to practice about Private and Public Routers and how to protect routes to be accessed if the user is not logged in. You can take a look at it [here](https://facureyes.github.io/heroes-app/)

### Login Screen

- Currently it only has a login button, but this could be a full functional login page. 
- Take into account that if the user isnt logged in, it won't be able to see the content of the app/

### Marvel & DC Screens

- Here you have a list of heroes from each company and if you click them it will show more details. 
- If you are logged in, the login page will redirect you to `/marvel`

### Search Screen

- A screen where you can search for any of the heroes available in the app.
